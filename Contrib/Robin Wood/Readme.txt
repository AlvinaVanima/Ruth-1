I have asked Robin Wood for permission to include her templates.

I am a member of the Roth & Ruth Project at https://github.com/RuthAndRoth/
We just realized that your skins require permission to post elsewhere.
Is it okay for us to put them there with credits? Roth and Ruth are the first Open Source
Full Perm Bento Avatars and we would love to include them as we use them constantly.

From Robin Wood on 5-Apr-2019:
Yes, you have my permission to post the templates wherever you’d like to post them. :D
I hope you are having a wonderful day!
Take care, Robin
